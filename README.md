# Node.js Calculator Web App

This simple web app serves a calculator written in plain HTML and JavaScript. It uses Node's built-in `http` module (no external dependencies). The server runs on port `3000` by default.

## Usage

Start the server with:

```bash
node server.js
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in a browser to use the calculator.
